## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Data
- Edit or add your DIY snippets in `data/diy_snippets.csv`

### 3. Run the End-to-End Demo

```bash
python scripts/demo.py
```
- This will load data, set up ChromaDB, generate embeddings, and run sample queries.

### 4. Try Interactive Semantic Search
